Notes App implemented using React, mobx
react-notes-app
==========

This is a clone of [notes-app-vuejs-vuex](https://github.com/coligo-io/notes-app-vuejs-vuex).What I do is re-implementing it using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html),[mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx),[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).
**Here is the [living demo](https://pengfu.github.io/react-notes-app/)**

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the dev server with hot reload at localhost:9090

```bash
npm run start
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
npm run build
```
